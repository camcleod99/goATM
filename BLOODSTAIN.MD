Spent an embarrassing amount of time (Which to be fair was caused by standard MAC OS upgrade / xcode path nonsense,
https://www.cyberithub.com/solved-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path-library-develop/ on how to fix that FFR)
not realising that the debug functionality was "freezing" because nether I (nor the tutorial I was using) had the good sense
of mind to print a "Please type here" message on noArgs.

YOU DIED.
